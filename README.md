This is one of my first hand-in assignments where I have to create a Fake News Feed site using HTML, CSS and PHP.

## Functionality
By looping over data arrays from `data.php` the site will show a continuous feed containing news items created by authors.

To fetch certain data from different arrays functions from `functions.php`are used.

### To-do:
- Implement improved styling using a GUI
  - Bootstrap
- Improve documentation in code
- Improve usage of functions
- Make sure code is "clean"
- Plenty of other things
