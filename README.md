This is one of my first hand-in assignments where I have to create a Fake News Feed site using HTML, CSS and PHP.
## Functionality
By looping over data arrays from `data.php` the site will show a continuous feed containing news items created by authors.

By using the `compareDates` function the array of news items is sorted so that the newest items are shown at the top of the feed

To fetch certain data from different arrays functions from `functions.php`are used.


### To-do:
- Implement improved styling using a GUI
  - Bootstrap
- Improve documentation in code
- Make sure code is "clean"
